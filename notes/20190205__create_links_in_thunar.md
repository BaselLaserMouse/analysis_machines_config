Hi, a not-that-easy to find feature of Thunar (the default file manager on Linux machines with Xubuntu) is how to create symbolic links for a bunch of files in a different folder:\
1. open a thunar window in the folder with the files, `<source folder>`\
2. open another thunar window in the target folder (where to create the links), `<dest. folder>`\
3. select the files of interest in  `<source folder>`, start dragging them (holding left mouse button)\
4. press and hold ctrl+shift keys\
5. finish dragging to `<dest. folder>`\
6. release mouse button, ctrl and shift keys\
That\'s it. (edited)
