Upgrade 16.04 to 18.04:

-   check sources in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` and remove old ones (and associated softwares)
-   purge nvidia and cuda (including local cuda repo), remove graphics-drivers ppa
-   upgrade using `do-release-upgrade`
-   install HWE to get kernel 5.0
-   install nvidia-430 from GUI
-   install cuda-toolkit-10.0 from local .deb

Remarks:

-   x2go is an official packages now, no need for external repository
-   no need for graphics-drivers PPA
-   use slack .deb package instead of snap (snap version has issues with icon and alt+tab list in xfce)
-   python regular virtual environments will break (python 3.5 to 3.6)
-   check homemade .deb packages, may break too
